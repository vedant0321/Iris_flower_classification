**IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

**Dataset Used** : "Iris.csv"

**Python libraries used :**
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* seaborn

**Applied :**
* DATA PROCESSING
* DATA CLEANING
* DATA VISUALIZATION
* MODEL BUILDING (Train-Test Split)
* APPROACHES OF MODELS

**Solved with :**
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
* Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
* Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**Technologies Used :**
